# DataMining
In this work, a console application has been developed, by which a user can search, “mine” and examine impressions from
around the web, about words that she will be asked to provide. The source code of this app comes along with a text file 
with selected websites (sites.txt), over which the user can take advantage of and make use of the abilities that the app 
gives her. In addition, user might provide her own list of websites and execute the app over them, as well. This app produces
a data base, in which all extracted data are stored, but user can extract these data into a JSON file, for further manipulation.
